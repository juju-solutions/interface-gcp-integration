"""
This is the provides side of the interface layer, for use only by the GCP
integration charm itself.

The flags that are set by the provides side of this interface are:

* **`endpoint.{endpoint_name}.requested`** This flag is set when there is
  a new or updated request by a remote unit for GCP integration features.
  The GCP integration charm should then iterate over each request, perform
  whatever actions are necessary to satisfy those requests, and then mark
  them as complete.
